Laura and her QUERIES On Tree
Problem
  Logan: "Someone will come along"
Charles: "Someone has come along"
After much speculation, Logan has decided to escort Laura to a place in North Dakota called "Eden".
But Laura is in playful mood right now, and wants Logan to play with her an interesting game.
She gives Logan a tree with N nodes and Q queries. Each query will contain 5 integers R A B X and Y.
R denotes the root node of the tree for the particular query.
A denotes the cost of an edge if one traverses from a node to its parent node.
B denotes the cost of an edge if one traverses from a node to its child node.
Consider 2 friends are standing at nodes X and Y respectively. They both need to meet and can meet at any node. Logan need to tell Laura what is the minimum cost they both need to pay to meet?

After a person travels through an edge (his current location gets updated), he needs to pay the cost which is equal to C * cost of edge where C is a factor whose value is equal to total edges traveled by a person from his starting location and upto his current location and cost of edge will be either equal to A or B depending upon the person's movement.
See sample input output for better understanding.
  Input
First line contains an integer N denoting number of nodes in tree.
Next N-1 lines contains two integers U and V denoting that there is an edge between node U and node V.
Next line contains an integer Q denoting number of queries.
Next Q lines contains five integers R, A, B, X and Y respectively.
  Output
For each query print required answer in a separate line.
  Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ U, V, R, X, Y ≤ N
1 ≤ Q ≤ 105
1 ≤ A, B ≤ 106

  Explanation
Query 1 : Following will be the tree orientation as root node is given as 3.

Consider both friends meet at node 3 than :
2nd friend will move from node 2 to node 1. Cost needed to be paid while traversing through this edge will be 1*5 = 5 (total distance traveled by 2nd friend after traversing current edge) * (edge cost which will be equal to 5 as there is a traversal from a node to its parent).
2nd friend will now move from node 1 to node 3. Cost needed to be paid while traversing through this edge will be 2*5 = 5 (total distance traveled by 2nd friend after traversing current edge) * (edge cost which will be equal to 5 as there is a traversal from a node to its parent).
Total cost = Total cost paid by 1st friend + Total cost paid by 2nd friend = 0 + 1*5 + 2*5 = 15

Similarly consider both friends meet at node 1 than :
2nd friend will move from node 2 to node 1. Cost needed to be paid while traversing through this edge will be 1*5 = 5 (total distance traveled by 2nd friend after traversing current edge) * (edge cost which will be equal to 5 as there is a traversal from a node to its parent).
1st friend will now move from node 3 to node 1. Cost needed to be paid while traversing through this edge will be 1*2 = 2 (total distance traveled by 1st friend after traversing current edge) * (edge cost which will be equal to 2 as there is a traversal from a node to its child).
Total cost = Total cost paid by 1st friend + Total cost paid by 2nd friend = 1*2 + 1*5 = 7

Similarly consider both friends meet at node 2 than :
1st friend will move from node 3 to node 1. Cost needed to be paid while traversing through this edge will be 1*2 = 2 (total distance traveled by 1st friend after traversing current edge) * (edge cost which will be equal to 2 as there is a traversal from a node to its child).
1st friend will now move from node 1 to node 2. Cost needed to be paid while traversing through this edge will be 2*2 = 4 (total distance traveled by 1st friend after traversing current edge) * (edge cost which will be equal to 2 as there is a traversal from a node to its child).
Total cost = Total cost paid by 1st friend + Total cost paid by 2nd friend = 1*2 + 2*2 + 0 = 6

Hence minimum cost needed to be paid by both the friends to meet is 6.
