Coprime Range
Problem
Read problem statements in Bengali, Mandarin Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese as well.
You are given a range of positive integers
L,L+1,…R. Find an integer
X greater than
1 which is coprime with all the integers in this range (does not share any common factors greater than
1 with any of these integers). In addition,
X must not exceed
2⋅10
9
.
If there are multiple solutions satisfying these conditions, you may find any one of them. It is guaranteed that for the given constraints, at least one such integer
X exists.
For example, if
L=16 and
R=17, then
X=9 is coprime with both
16 and
17. However, if
L=6 and
R=12 instead, then
X=9 shares a common factor
3 with
6 and
12 and a common factor
9 with
9.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
T denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
L and
R.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer
X which satisfies the above conditions.

Explanation:
Example case 1:
X=9 does not share any common factors with
16 and
17.
Example case 2:
X=27 does not share any common factors with
16 and
17.
Example case 3:
X=79 does not share any common factors with any of the integers
973360,973361,…,973432.
