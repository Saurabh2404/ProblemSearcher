Chef likes problems related to numbers a lot. He is generally quite good at solving these kinds of problems, but today he got stuck at one number theory problem, and so he asks your help to solve it.
Given a positive integer N, find out how many positive integers X satisfy the equation X + S(X) + S(S(X)) = N, where S(X) denoting sum of digits of X in decimal (base 10) representation.
Input
The only line of the input contains one integer number - N.
Output
Output single integer in a line denoting the count of number of positive integers X satisfying the above given equation.
Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 109
Sample 1:
Input
Output
6
1
Explanation:
Example 1. Only one positive integer X = 2 satisfies the equation X + S(X) + S(S(X)) = 6, as X + S(X) + S(S(X)) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
Sample 2:
Input
Output
9939
4
Explanation:
Example 2.X can be 9898, 9907, 9910 and 9913.
9898 + S(9898) + S(S(9898)) = 9898 + 34 + 7 = 9939
9907 + S(9907) + S(S(9907)) = 9907 + 25 + 7 = 9939
9910 + S(9910) + S(S(9910)) = 9910 + 19 + 10 = 9939
9913 + S(9913) + S(S(9913)) = 9913 + 22 + 4 = 9939
You can verify that there is not other positive value of X satisfying the given equation.
